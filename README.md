# Rubiks-Cube
The Rubiks-Cube repo is a project where I am testing and learning about how PyGame works. 
This is my personal project in attempting to create a python version of a Rubik's cube. 
The goals of the project will be the following in order of priority:  
  (1) Create Rubik's Cube in PyGame that can be solved view keyboard or onscreen controls
  (2) Create an auto-solver that can solve and display the most efficient way to solve the cube from the starting position
  (3) Eventually Learn how to train AI to solve the Rubik's Cube!
